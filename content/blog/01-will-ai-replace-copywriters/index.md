Let's face it. AI's coming. And sooner or later, it's gonna take most of our jobs. That's Ok, because it eliminates a lot of human error and in the end, it'll make our lives easier. But then again, we lose out on a chance to work the good old jobs we used to do because now the only jobs left will be things AI can't do yet. And at the moment, AI sure as heck can't copywrite stuff.

But what if it could some day?

Maybe. Maybe not.

Now, I for one, believe you can't make a computer copywrite as effectively as a human. Why, you ask? Here's why -

# Empathy

Whip out your iPhone, or android phone, open Siri/Google Assistant, and say you're sad. I'm pretty sure there's a better chance they'll offer you their condolences than actually listen to your problems. And that's perfectly normal. You can't expect machines/softwares to understand how you feel because they just don't get emotion.

And no matter how human you try to make UI, you can't really make it empathise with people because emotion is something it can't get ahold of. Yet. I'm sure we're all dreading the day when AI will suddenly become self aware and say, "Hasta la vista, baby!", but right now, and for a safe period after, we're all there is in copywriting.

And only humans can write copy that appeals to humans. Because we care. It's as simple as that.

For now. :)
